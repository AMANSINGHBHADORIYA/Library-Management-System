 we have successfully designed a Library management system using python and tkinter with a decent UI. In order to make things easy, this divided the various tasks into different python files. In the real world, we follow such practices to make things easy to build. Hence, whenever making a project, divide your goals into modules and integrate them at a later stage.

Apart from this, you can now take a step forward to extend the project by making a history tab which keeps track of the previous books issued. Moreover, you can integrate a login system to authenticate a user before making changes to the database
